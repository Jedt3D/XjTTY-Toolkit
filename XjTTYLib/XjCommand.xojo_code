		XjCommand — Shell Command Execution

		Part of XjTTY-Toolkit (Polish phase).
		Execute shell commands with output capture, timeout, and dry-run.

		Usage:
		  Var result As XjCommandResult = XjCommand.Run("ls -la")
		  Print(result.Output)
		  If result.ExitCode = 0 Then Print("Success!")

		  Var output As String = XjCommand.Capture("git status")
		  If XjCommand.Success("which git") Then Print("git found")
